<h1>Piloting</h1>

<p>Piloting a VideoRay ROV requires a combination of understanding the system's operating principles, features and capabilities, situational awareness (which is much more challenging when you cannot see the vehicle), personal skills and experience.</p>

<p>The VideoRay Pro 4 has several pilot assist tools that provide auto control of the vehicles functions and other sensors that help with situational awareness.  Several optional accessories can provide even further situational awareness, such as sonars and position tracking systems.  Autonomous operation is also possible through the CoPilot series of applications, including CoPilot Survey, CoPilot Sonar and CoPilot RI (Reacquire and Identify).</p>

<p>The following sections provide information about built in pilot-assist tools and piloting tactics for specific situations.</p>
