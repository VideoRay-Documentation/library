<h3>Cygnus Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge</h3>

<p>The Cygnus Instruments ultrasonic thickness gauge can be used to measure metal thickness even through coatings.  The probe does not need to touch the surface under test, as measurements can be taken through 5 mm (0.2 inch) of water.  Readings are not influenced by the probe's orientation.</p>
