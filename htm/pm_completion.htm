<h1>Project Completion</h1>

<p>On-site, the system should be cleaned as best as possible and stowed for transport.  Be careful when closing lids to avoid pinching any cables or damaging the video display components of the computer or the control panel.

<p>Upon return to the home base, other tasks that should be considered before stowing the equipment include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clean and inspect the equipment.</li>
  <li>Make any necessary repairs so system is ready to go next time.</li>
  <li>Complete any operations and maintenance logs.</li>
  <li>Produce and deliver the project reports.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Project Deliverables</h2>

<p>Often, the completion of a project means delivering a product, such as images or videos of an inspection, or retrieval of an item.  These can be delivered as isolated products or as part of a formal report.  See the <a href="../../<!--i-->$$htmlDir<!--/i-->completion_video.html">Images and Videos</a> section of the <a href="<!--i-->$$htmlDir<!--/i-->oper_.html">Operations Guide</a> for more information about still image and video post-processing and production.</p>
