<h1>Data Management</h1>

<p>Images and videos captured during a mission are store in the <span class="folder"><!--5-->Home/videos<!--/5--><!--0-->C:\Users\VideoRay\My Documents\VideoRay\Imagery\<!--/0--></span>,<!--0--> (<span class="folder">C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\VideoRay\Imagery\</span> for Windows XP)<!--/0-->.  These files should be moved to a project folder after each mission so that the imagery folder does not get overpopulated with mix of files from various projects.  When viewing files, it can be hard to distinguish one underwater location from another.  Preferably, these files should also be backed up to separate media.</p>
