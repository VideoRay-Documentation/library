<h1>Piloting in Confined Spaces</h1>

<p>When piloting in confined spaces, the gravest concerns are getting stuck or getting the tether snagged on an obstruction.</p>

<p>The best techniques are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p>Ballast the ROV as close to neutral as possible</li>
  <li><p></p>Proceed slowly and plan ahead before entering tight spaces</li>
  <li><p></p>Observe the entire immediate surroundings, including up and down, for any obstacles that might entrap the ROV or snag the tether</li>
  <li><p></p>Have someone feed tether as close to the entry point as possible</li>
  <li><p></p>Move slowly and deliberately to avoid stirring up silt</li>
  </ul>

<p>If the ROV or tether does get stuck, assess the situation as best as possible in order to avoid making the situation worse.  See the section on <a href="emergency_snag.html">Emergency Response to a Snagged Tether/ROV</a> for additional tips.</p>
