<h1>Accessories - Imagery</h1>

<p>A second <a href="videoray_camera_external.html">external camera</a> can be mounted on the VideoRay to provide images in angles that otherwise would be difficult using just the main camera.  The external camera can be mounted so the image direction is lateral, to the rear or vertically up or down.</p>

<p>When the highest quality underwater imagery is desired, a <a href="acc_videoray_hidef.html">high definition camera</a> can be mounted on the VideoRay.  Obviously, the water visibility has to be quite good to be able to use the high definition camera effectively.</p>

<p>ROVs are often operated in water conditions with limited visibility.  Several accessories have been designed and engineered to support this need.</p>

<p>The <a href="acc_lyyn.html">LYYN Visibility Enhancement Systems</a> provide real time video image clarification in cloudy or turbid water.</p>

<p>When the water conditions are too poor to support the required range of visibility, sonar can be used to "See" beyond the visible range.  See the section on <a href="acc_sonar.html">sonar accessories</a> for more information.</p>
