<h1>Image and Video Editing and Production</h1>

<p>You can record snapshots and video.  The count of snapshots and videos is displayed in the video window's title bar at the top.  These numbers are for the current session and reset each time you start VideoRay Cockpit.</p>

<p>You can edit and produce video files or DVDs.  The following sections provide more information on each of these steps.</p>

<p>The best quality output requires good input.  Adjust the lights and focus to give the best starting image quality. More light does not always provide a better picture - back scatter from particles can obscure your intended objective.  Light position can also make a big difference.  Auxiliary lighting from the side can produce an image that looks like it was taken in air.</p>

<p>The camera supports several special lighting modes like Wide Dynamic Range, Back Light Compensation and Digital Slow Shutter.  See the <a href="menu_camera.html">Camera Menu</a> in the <a href="cockpit_.html">VideoRay Cockpit Guide</a> for more information.</p>
