<h1>Mission Planning</h1>

<p>Once the basic objectives for an ROV mission have been established, there are several additional, and critical, requirements that need to be identified before rushing off to the dive site.  Each of these additional requirements can be defined by developing a list of questions and thinking through the answers.  Some of the answers may lead to more questions.  With the information gathered by answering the questions, appropriate decisions can be made and your plan developed.</p>

<p>Below is a representative list of requirements and corresponding questions.  This list is not comprehensive, and is only intended to serve as a guide for you to develop your own list of appropriate requirements and questions.</p>
