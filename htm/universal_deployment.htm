<h1>Deployment Platforms</h1>

<p>VideoRay ROVs can be deployed from land, vessels, remotely or even some very unique situations.  Power can be provided by a shore based system, a generator or a battery with an inverter.</p>

<h2>Height above Water Surface</h2>

<p>VideoRays can be deployed from a significant height above the water surface by lowering the vehicle by its tether.</p>

<h2>Land</h2>

<p>For land-based deployments using shore power the biggest issue is usually how close can you get to the water.  When operating in tanks, beware of active inlets or discharges and avoid using the ROV or tether near these areas.  Many tanks also have cathodic protection systems, which can become a snare and entrapment hazard to the ROV.</p>

<h2>Vessels</h2>

<p>When operative from vessels, it is important to  be aware of potential risks to personnel or the equipment.  Whenever possible, conduct ROV operations when the vessel is at anchor or adrift without the propulsion system engaged.  When the vessel's propulsion system must be engaged during ROV deployment, tether management is critical to ensure the tether or the ROV do not come in contact with the vessel's propulsion systems.  Water intakes and discharges can also be hazardous to the ROV and should be locked out or the ROV and tether kept a safe distance.

<h2>Remote Operations</h2>

<p>VideoRays can be operated remotely using Internet technologies.  See the section on <a href="oper_remote.html">Using Network Remote</a> for more information.</p>
