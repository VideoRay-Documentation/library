<h1>Accessories - Sonar</h1>

<p>When long range vision is needed in water with low visibility, sonar can be used to "see" beyond the range of visibility.  Sonar stands for <b>SO</b>und <b>NA</b>vigation and <b>R</b>anging and uses sound echos to create an image of the surrounding environment.  VideoRay supports the <a href="equip_tritech_sonar.html">Tritech SeaSprite</a>, a scanning sonar that operates similar to a traditional radar screen, and multibeam sonars from <a href="equip_teledyne_blueview.html">Teledyne BlueView</a> and <a href="equip_tritech_sonar.html">Tritech </a>that create images similar to a medical ultrasound.</p>
