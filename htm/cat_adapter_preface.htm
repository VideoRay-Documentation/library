<p>VideoRay's <a href="videoray_pam_use.html">PAM</a> and <a href="videoray_tina_use.html">TINA</a> devices are not accessories by themselves, but they allow tighter integration of several existing accessories, and allow accessory devices that would not otherwise be compatible with the Pro 4 to be tightly integrated.</p>
