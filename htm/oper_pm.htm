<h1>Project Management</h1>

<p>While the differences between conducting a recreational dive, an inspection of an offshore well riser, and a drowning victim recovery are quite dramatic, each of these dive missions usually consist of the following phases:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Establish the need, objectives and acceptable outcomes of the mission</li>
  <li>Plan the mission</li>
  <li>Prepare for the mission</li>
  <li>Execute the mission</li>
  <li>Conclude the mission</li>
  <li>Compile and deliver project reports</li>
  </ol>

<p>Of course, how critical a successful outcome is deemed and how much lead time and how many resources are available will dictate how much effort can or will be afforded to each phase.

<p>The essential knowledge and skills required for a consistent ability to "get the job done" go well beyond just being able to set up and pilot an ROV.  In this section, the following topics will be discussed to help broaden your understanding of the scope of practical ROV applications.
