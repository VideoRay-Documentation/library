<h2>Unequal Grounds</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> All power grounds are not created equal...  It is more common than you would imagine that the power ground is not at the same potential as the water.  This will create a ground loop that can cause noise on the video signal or even lead to a shock if you touch a grounded part of the system and water at the same time.  VideoRay includes a ground lift adapter cord that can be used to isolate the control panel ground.  All connected devices must be connected through this adapter.  For example, a monitor connected directly to the power source and to the computer via a monitor cable, will reintroduce the bad ground into the system.</p>
