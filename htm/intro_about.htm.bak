<h2>Library Navigation</h2>

<p>You can navigate through the library to specific topics using the menu, or step through sequentially using the Next and Previous arrowhead buttons.  However, these buttons do not navigate to the individual documents.  You must use the menu to access the individual documents.  The Next button will step you from the current topic to the next topic at the same level unless the current topic has a sub-topic.  If the current topic has a sub-topic, the Next button will step you into the first sub-topic.  The Previous button works similarly, but in reverse sequence.  Your current location within the document is shown as a "breadcrumb" trail at the top of each page under the document title.  You can click on any level of the breadcrumb hierarchy to go that location.  You can also use the following keyboard shortcuts:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      ACTION
      </th>
    <th>
      KEYSTROKE or BUTTON
      </th>
    </tr>

<h2>Quality Commitment</h2>

<p>VideoRay strives to design, manufacture, deliver and support the highest quality products and services, including this documentation.   We have made every effort to ensure that this documentation is accurate and provides you with the most up-to-date information.  However, there is no substitute for experience and/or training, especially with respect to the real purpose for which you plan to use this equipment.  We encourage you to explore options beyond the scope of these materials to expand your knowledge and skills necessary to support your application.  In addition to this documentation, VideoRay offers training and technical support and hosts a general user discussion forum and user image gallery.</p> 

<p>We also realize that collectively, users of our products spend considerably more time operating our systems than we do ourselves.  Users also encounter more diverse operating environments across an extremely broad range of applications.  We highly value this vast experience base, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us by any of the following methods.</p>
