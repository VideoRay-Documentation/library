<p><i>"Desert Star offers survey-grade accuracy, application optimized, modular and affordable underwater acoustic positioning systems."</i></p>

<p>For VideoRay users, Desert Star provides several versions of acoustic position tracking systems.  These systems include baseline stations that are deployed from a dock or a vessel and an ROV mobile station that is attached to the ROV.</p>

<p>The Desert Star Pilot system offers the tracking capability of a USBL system and the survey-grade accuracy of a long baseline system in one compact package.</p>

<p>AquaMap Seafloor offers robust performance in harbors, on shallow reefs and in the deep oceans alike. ROV pilots can pinpoint their location and fix objects within tens of centimeters.  Seafloor includes GPS integration, image annotation, chart overlay and real-time export to mapping applications.</p>

<p>Deployed in minutes on any vessel, AquaMap ShipHull "paints" a trace of the ROV's path on a computer image of the hull.  When the hull is painted, the job is done.</p>
